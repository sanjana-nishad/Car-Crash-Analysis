# Car-Crash-Analysis
Developed a detailed car model in CATIA utilizing both Part Design and Assembly Design modules to create precise 3D components and integrate them into a complete assembly. Performed Explicit Dynamics Analysis in ANSYS to study the carâ€™s structural response under high-impact loading conditions. Assigned aluminum alloy as the material for the car body to achieve a lightweight yet robust structure, while concrete was used for the wall to simulate realistic collision scenarios. Conducted an in-depth analysis of directional deformation, total deformation, equivalent stress, and equivalent plastic strain to evaluate the structural integrity, energy absorption capacity, and potential failure zones of the vehicle under impact forces.
