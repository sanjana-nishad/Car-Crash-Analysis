# Car-Crash-Analysis
Designed a car in CATIA using Part and Assembly Design. Performed Explicit Dynamics Analysis in ANSYS with aluminum alloy for the car body and concrete for the wall. Analyzed directional deformation, total deformation, equivalent stress, and equivalent plastic strain to assess structural performance.
